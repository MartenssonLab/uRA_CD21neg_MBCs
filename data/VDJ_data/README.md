# VDJ-Seq Data Files
This directory contains relevant filtered VDJ-seq data files for the script analyses and plotting. Files marked as VDJ-seq doublets contain barcodes of cells considered doublets, e.g., due to expressing more than one productive heavy chain. Filtered VDJ-seq data for the cells in cluster 3.1 in ueRA4 is also available for BCR analyses and plotting.
