This repository is associated with the manuscript *An antigen processing and presenting gene signature in circulating and synovial Tbet+CD11c+ B cells suggests disease dependent functions*.

Herein, the R code required to reproduce the analyses reported in the publication. The sequencing data can be found in ArrayExpress, in the form of FASTQ files, under the accession numbers ###### (gene expression data) and ##### (BCR data).

## scRNA-Seq Analysis
Although the sequencing data is not available on this page, the scripts are based on a specific structure of directories, found within the [data/](data/) directory. To re-run the analyses of the scRNA-seq data, the sequencing data can be downloaded and placed into directories as indicated. From thereon out, the scripts detail the overall workflow for processing and analysis.
